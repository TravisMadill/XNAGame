# XNAGAME

This is a game I made as a final project in my Grade 12 programming class.

It uses the now-deprecated XNA framework to run, but the exe files should still be in the debug folders if you want to try it out for yourself.

Because this was an actual project for me, this repository contains some stuff I wouldn't normally include in my usual mini-projects, like flowcharts and detailed comments and an actual readme file.

## Original readme to my programming teacher
This game is a 2D sidescroller. But instead of running and jumping, you instead run
and shoot things! By clicking anywhere on screen, you can fire a rocket-bullet and
use that to defeat enemies. The objective is like any sidescroller, where you try to
get to the end of the level.

There are several things that you should know before starting browsing through or
playing, there are some commented out debug features that I never deleted. Mainly
for the reason that I won't necessarily stop all work on this game, and seeing some
of the debug in action may help seeing how some mechanics work, so there's that.
Secondly, I am aware that some floor detection isn't perfect, but the flicker from
the enemy that suffers from this actually looked like a new sprite that was really
sad that it was falling through the floor. It was amusing to me (Also, time 
constraints). I'd recommend that when you look through the code, I'd suggest looking
at the Being class first and the BeingTemplates classes. Then everything else, then
it'll make sense.

If you were going to decide which to do first, play the game or look at the code, I
would say to play the game first. It's really short. There are only 3 levels. The only
reason there is that many is because of time constraints. I needed to work on my
ISU and stuff from every other class kept piling up, and keeping up with all of them
is hard work.

Anyway, all sound credit is thanks to SoundJay.com for their library of royalty-free
sound effects, and Pixel Joint for the background of the levels. Pretty much
everything else was drawn in MS Paint and used the school's copy of Photoshop to
add transparency (that's really annoying). I feel like such a great artist.
